# CS190Final: Image-Based Algorithmic Composition

We have experimented with using data from an image to generate music. In order to imply a clearer relationship between the image and the music, we heavily rely on existing notions of the relationship between visual and audio cues. This included using the color-pitch mapping from Scriabin's clavier à lumières to generate the key and relating the continuity of hue to the continuity of pitch. In order to create something with heavier tonal inspiration, we also implemented some randomized improvisation in our.
